# Efficiently computing extremal points in cylindrical coordinates
This project was created as part of a Bachelorthesis. The thesis was about efficiently computing extremal points 
using spatial datastructures. The algorithm for extremal points was then used to calculate
the convex hull to demonstrate and evaluate the approach. For a more detailed
description see [this documentation Website (in German)](https://fabianstroschke.github.io/efficiently_computing_extremal_points_in_cylindrical_coordinates/)
